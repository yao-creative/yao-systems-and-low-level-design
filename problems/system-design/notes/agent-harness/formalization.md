Below is a **fully formal kernel specification** of your agent harness: state machines, actors, queues, scheduler, and router—written in a way that cleanly separates:

* state spaces
* transition functions
* morphisms (communication)
* execution semantics
* concurrency structure

I’ll structure it like a **small execution calculus** first, then map it to category theory.

---

# 0. System goal (formal intent)

We define an agent system as a tuple:

[
\mathcal{H} = (S, A, Q, R, \Delta, \Sigma, \mathcal{T})
]

Where:

* (S): state space (internal logic states)
* (A): actors (execution units)
* (Q): queues (message buffers)
* (R): router (addressing function)
* (\Delta): state transition semantics
* (\Sigma): message algebra
* (\mathcal{T}): scheduler (time evolution)

---

# 1. Message algebra (core communication primitive)

## 1.1 Messages

Let:

[
m \in \Sigma
]

A message is:

[
m := (src, dst, payload, meta)
]

Where:

* (src \in A \cup {\bot})
* (dst \in A)
* (payload \in P)
* (meta \in M) (timestamps, priority, id)

---

## 1.2 Message space

[
\Sigma = A \times A \times P \times M
]

---

# 2. State machine (pure logic kernel)

## 2.1 Definition

A state machine is:

[
\mathcal{M} = (S, E, \delta)
]

Where:

* (S): state space
* (E): event/message space
* (\delta): transition function

---

## 2.2 Transition function

[
\delta : S \times E \rightarrow S
]

Optionally with output:

[
\delta : S \times E \rightarrow S \times O
]

---

## 2.3 Laws (determinism)

For all (s, e):

[
\delta(s, e) \text{ is deterministic}
]

No dependence on external state.

---

# 3. Actor model (execution unit)

## 3.1 Actor definition

An actor is:

[
a \in A := (id, \mathcal{M}, q)
]

Where:

* (id): identity
* (\mathcal{M}): state machine
* (q \in Q): mailbox queue

---

## 3.2 Actor semantics

Actor evolution is:

[
step(a) := \text{if } q \neq \emptyset \text{ then process next message}
]

---

## 3.3 Internal update rule

Let:

* (s) be internal state
* (m) be message

Then:

[
s' = \delta(s, m)
]

Actor updates state machine only locally.

---

## 3.4 Concurrency invariant

Actors satisfy:

> **single-threaded mailbox processing**

[
\forall a,\ \text{only one } m \in q \text{ is processed at a time}
]

---

# 4. Queue (message buffer system)

## 4.1 Queue definition

A queue is:

[
Q := (M, \prec, \mu)
]

Where:

* (M): multiset of messages
* (\prec): ordering relation
* (\mu): mutation operations

---

## 4.2 Core operations

### enqueue

[
enqueue : Q \times m \rightarrow Q
]

### dequeue

[
dequeue : Q \rightarrow Q \times m
]

(partial if empty)

---

## 4.3 Ordering laws

### FIFO:

[
m_1 \prec m_2 \Rightarrow dequeue(m_1) \text{ before } dequeue(m_2)
]

or more generally:

[
\prec \subseteq M \times M
]

defines partial or total order.

---

## 4.4 Reliable queue extension

Add acknowledgment state:

[
Q_r = (M_{pending}, M_{inflight}, ack)
]

Operations:

* deliver:
  [
  Q \rightarrow (Q, m)
  ]

* ack:
  [
  Q \times id \rightarrow Q
  ]

---

# 5. Router (addressing morphism)

## 5.1 Definition

Router is:

[
R : M \rightarrow A
]

It maps messages to actors.

---

## 5.2 Properties

### determinism:

[
R(m) = a \text{ is deterministic or policy-defined}
]

### partitioning:

Actors define partition of message space:

[
\bigcup_{a \in A} R^{-1}(a) = M
]

---

## 5.3 Router as morphism selector

Router chooses:

> which actor morphism will process a message

So:

[
R : \Sigma \rightarrow \text{Hom}(A)
]

---

# 6. Scheduler (time evolution system)

## 6.1 Definition

Scheduler:

[
\mathcal{T} : (A, Q) \rightarrow A^*
]

Where:

* outputs execution order of actors

---

## 6.2 Execution step

Global step:

[
System(t+1) = \mathcal{T}(System(t))
]

---

## 6.3 Scheduling policies

Scheduler defines ordering relation:

* round robin
* priority
* event-driven

Formally:

[
\leq_{\mathcal{T}} \subseteq A \times A
]

---

# 7. Full system dynamics

## 7.1 Global state

[
X = (S_A, Q, R)
]

Where:

* (S_A): all actor states
* (Q): all queues
* (R): routing map

---

## 7.2 Transition function

System evolves via:

[
X_{t+1} = F(X_t)
]

Where:

[
F = \mathcal{T} \circ \text{dispatch} \circ \text{route} \circ \text{transition}
]

Expanded:

1. scheduler picks actor
2. router assigns message
3. actor processes message
4. state machine updates state
5. queue updates

---

# 8. Category theory formalization

Now we compress into categorical structure.

---

## 8.1 Category definition

Define category:

[
\mathbf{AgentSys}
]

### Objects:

* (A): actors
* (S): state spaces
* (Q): queues
* (M): messages

---

## 8.2 Morphisms

### state transition:

[
\delta : S \times M \rightarrow S
]

### routing:

[
R : M \rightarrow A
]

### queue evolution:

[
\mu : Q \times M \rightarrow Q
]

### scheduling:

[
\mathcal{T} : System \rightarrow System
]

---

## 8.3 System as coalgebra

The system is a coalgebra:

[
X \rightarrow F(X)
]

Where functor:

[
F(X) = (S \times Q \times M)^{A}
]

Interpretation:

* each actor produces next state + messages

---

## 8.4 Key insight

This system is:

> a **coalgebraic network of interacting state machines mediated by ordered morphism channels**

---

# 9. Interface system (your original goal)

Now we map each component to a fixed interface:

---

## StateMachine

[
\delta : S \times E \rightarrow S
]

---

## Actor

[
step : (S, Q) \rightarrow (S, Q)
]

---

## Queue

[
Q : enqueue, dequeue, ack
]

with ordering law (\prec)

---

## Router

[
R : M \rightarrow A
]

---

## Scheduler

[
\mathcal{T} : System \rightarrow System
]

---

# 10. Final synthesis

Your system is:

> a **composed coalgebra of deterministic state machines interacting through ordered message morphisms under a scheduler-defined temporal operator**

---

# 11. One-line compression

> The agent harness is a coalgebraic execution system where actors are local state machines, queues are ordered morphism buffers, routing is a selection functor, and scheduling defines global temporal unfolding.

---

If you want next step, I can:

* derive a **minimal executable kernel (pseudo-Rust / Python)**
* or show how this collapses into a **single monadic + actor hybrid abstraction**
* or prove which parts are “must-be-fixed interfaces” vs “policy layers” in a formal decomposition theorem
